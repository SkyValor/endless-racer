# Endless Racing Game

This project marks the final work of my programming class at the Game Design course I attended. At the time, I admit, I wasn't really good at it. Still, I was keeping at it everyday.

The conditions for this game were:

• The player controls a car
• Movement is made horizontaly and verticaly
• Going off-track slows-down the movement
• There are bonus items for the player to catch that will boost his speed
• There are other cars with patterned movement that the player should avoid
• There is another car, with AI (artifitial intelligence) movement that should want to crash at the player

At the beginning of this exercise, I was fairly bad. But with enough work, I was able to reach the Minimum Viable Product and even work up some features on the AI of the car.

Version 1.0 is the finished product.
Next, I will refactor that code, because God knows what a huge mess that is. With the knowledge I have today, I have to re-write so MANY things in that code.
