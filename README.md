# Endless Racing Game

The conditions (MVP) for this game are:

• The player controls a car
• Movement is made horizontaly and verticaly
• Going off-track slows-down the movement
• There are bonus items for the player to catch that will boost his speed
• There are other cars with patterned movement that the player should avoid
• There is another car, with AI (artifitial intelligence) movement that should want to crash at the player

Version 1.0 is the finished product.
Next, I will refactor that code, because God knows what a huge mess that is. With the knowledge I have today, I have to re-write so MANY things in that code. I will keep commit every time I make a new change in the code.
